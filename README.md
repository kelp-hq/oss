The Macula is a missing layer for IPFS with built-in features like API authentication, on-the-fly image processing, secure file storage, and hosting for modern SPA or statically built websites. Macula App enables users to encrypt and decrypt files using the Substrate-based accounts and store them on the IPFS.

üèóÔ∏è The current set of features:

- Authenticated APIs using
  - API key strategy
  - web3 substrate-based account via Polkadot.js browser extension
- Access to IPFS native API on `macula.link/ipfs_api/`
- IPFS gateway served on `macula.link/ipfs/CID`
- Website hosting with CID or a subdomain
  - hosting specific version `https://bafybeiabw7h2j2wvpjzzi55oajj2yr3z7ifu2zfj2kpfefu2pulfljfx74.on.macula.link/`
  - hosting subdomain `https://test-website.macula.link/`
- SPA hosting with fully working refresh and html fallback page as a subdomain
- Statically build websites
  - if used with sveltekit Macula supported `precompress` feature and will serve Brotli compressed pages
- Gzip is enabled by default and Brotli only when requested
- highly efficient image processing based on Sharpjs via the URL search params
  - https://macula.kelp.digital/ipfs/bafybeic4fqttg2k6ibirqs57zcl3b2jd7hjnq22biyp542lfjhdyx5ausi/DSC02764.jpg?w=1000&h=400

## __Macula cli for IPFS__

Important files:

- [README.md](./tools/ipfs-cli/README.md)
- [AGPLv3 LICENSE](./tools/ipfs-cli/LICENSE)

Custom built CLI that can be used to with the Macula authentication scheme to upload files directly to the IPFS without using the remote pinning service. It's using the http api as defined in the IPFS documentation. Besides the uploading the files, the Macula ClI is used to publish the websites to the Macula service register the subdomains and add the website version to it.

## __sveltekit adapter for macula__

Important files:

- [README.md](./tools/sveltekit-adapter-macula/README.md)
- [AGPLv3 LICENSE](./tools/sveltekit-adapter-macula/LICENSE)

Plainly put, Svelte is awesome! For that reason we are supporting it first and also because we are using it. This adapter will create `.macula/macula.json` file which contains everything that is needed to properly serve the website.

[Here](https://bafybeihonkvcaf5riqp6figuoe7l2nxrc6w3spnrqlioviabkda46k4ffe.ipfs.anagolay.network/macula.json) is the example of the macula.json for the [static website](https://bafybeihonkvcaf5riqp6figuoe7l2nxrc6w3spnrqlioviabkda46k4ffe.ipfs.anagolay.network).

As you can see that some of the static built website you can already use with properly confugured IPFS node, unfortunately ipfs on anagolay.network does not have macula installed and will never gzip nor optimise the responses.
